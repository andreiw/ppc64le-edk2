/**
  This function registers the handler NotifyFunction so it is called every time
  the timer interrupt fires.  It also passes the amount of time since the last
  handler call to the NotifyFunction.  If NotifyFunction is NULL, then the
  handler is unregistered.  If the handler is registered, then EFI_SUCCESS is
  returned.  If the CPU does not support registering a timer interrupt handler,
  then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.  If an attempt is made to register a handler
  when a handler is already registered, then EFI_ALREADY_STARTED is returned.
  If an attempt is made to unregister a handler when a handler is not registered,
  then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned.  If an error occurs attempting to
  register the NotifyFunction with the timer interrupt, then EFI_DEVICE_ERROR
  is returned.

  @param  This             The EFI_TIMER_ARCH_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  NotifyFunction   The function to call when a timer interrupt fires. This
                           function executes at TPL_HIGH_LEVEL. The DXE Core will
                           register a handler for the timer interrupt, so it can know
                           how much time has passed. This information is used to
                           signal timer based events. NULL will unregister the handler.
  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The timer handler was registered.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The platform does not support timer interrupts.
  @retval EFI_ALREADY_STARTED   NotifyFunction is not NULL, and a handler is already
                                registered.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER NotifyFunction is NULL, and a handler was not
                                previously registered.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The timer handler could not be registered.

  This function adjusts the period of timer interrupts to the value specified
  by TimerPeriod.  If the timer period is updated, then the selected timer
  period is stored in EFI_TIMER.TimerPeriod, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned.  If
  the timer hardware is not programmable, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.
  If an error occurs while attempting to update the timer period, then the
  timer hardware will be put back in its state prior to this call, and
  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR is returned.  If TimerPeriod is 0, then the timer interrupt
  is disabled.  This is not the same as disabling the CPU's interrupts.
  Instead, it must either turn off the timer hardware, or it must adjust the
  interrupt controller so that a CPU interrupt is not generated when the timer
  interrupt fires.

/**
  Interface structure for the Timer Architectural Protocol.

  @par Protocol Description:
  This protocol provides the services to initialize a periodic timer
  interrupt, and to register a handler that is called each time the timer
  interrupt fires.  It may also provide a service to adjust the rate of the
  periodic timer interrupt.  When a timer interrupt occurs, the handler is
  passed the amount of time that has passed since the previous timer
  interrupt.

  @param RegisterHandler
  Registers a handler that will be called each time the
  timer interrupt fires.  TimerPeriod defines the minimum
  time between timer interrupts, so TimerPeriod will also
  be the minimum time between calls to the registered
  handler.

  @param SetTimerPeriod
  Sets the period of the timer interrupt in 100 nS units.
  This function is optional, and may return EFI_UNSUPPORTED.
  If this function is supported, then the timer period will
  be rounded up to the nearest supported timer period.


  @param GetTimerPeriod
  Retrieves the period of the timer interrupt in 100 nS units.

  @param GenerateSoftInterrupt
  Generates a soft timer interrupt that simulates the firing of
  the timer interrupt. This service can be used to invoke the   registered handler if the timer interrupt has been masked for
  a period of time.
